Adsorption File Parser
======================

A pure python parser to sorption files from various instrumentation manufacturers.
It comes with minimal dependencies and maximum flexibility.

Currently supports files from:

- Micromeritics (.xls reports)
- Surface Measurement Systems DVS (.xlsx reports)
- 3P instruments (.xlsx reports)
- Quantachrome (.txt raw isotherm data)
- MicrotracBEL (.dat, .xls and .csv files)

Installation
============

Install using pip

.. code:: bash

    pip install adsorption-file-parser


Documentation
=============

The main read function returns two dictionaries:
a ``meta`` dictionary, which contains various metadata
that is present in the report (date, user, units)
and the ``data`` dictionary, containing lists
of individual isotherm data.

.. code:: bash

    from adsorption_file_parser import read
    meta, data = read(
        path="path/to/file",
        manufacturer="manufacturer",
        fmt="supported format"
    )
